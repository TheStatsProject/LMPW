Regardless of where you are in your career, it's never too early—or too late—to start planning for retirement. This guide provides age-appropriate strategies for building long-term financial security.

## The Power of Starting Early

Time is your greatest asset in retirement planning. Consider the math:

- **Starting at 25**: $500/month at 7% annual return = ~$1.2M by 65
- **Starting at 35**: Same contribution = ~$567K by 65
- **Starting at 45**: Same contribution = ~$245K by 65

## Strategies by Life Stage

### In Your 20s: Foundation Building

Priority actions:

1. Establish emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
2. Maximize employer 401(k) match
3. Open a Roth IRA
4. Develop good financial habits

### In Your 30s: Acceleration Phase

Key focus areas:
