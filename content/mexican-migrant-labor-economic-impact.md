In a time when misinformation spreads faster than facts, separating myth from reality has never been more crucial. Following President Claudia Sheinbaum's recent [comments](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/las-y-los-migrantes-contribuyen-a-la-economia-de-estados-unidos-presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-en-2024-aportaron-al-pib-781-mil-mdd) on employment, migration, foreign trade, and economic history, a vital question resurfaces:

**What is the true economic impact of Mexican immigrants in the United States?**

To answer this question, we went straight to the source by analyzing data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) and the [Federal Reserve's FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) database. The findings we uncovered may challenge common narratives, and believe me, they will.

This is a fact-based analysis, based solely on official U.S. government sources. No opinions or manipulations, just the numbers that matter, just the raw facts. Nothing else, just science to restore balance.
