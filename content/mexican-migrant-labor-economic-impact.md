"Economic Insights: The Untold Story of Mexican Migrant Labor and Their Transformative Impact on U.S. GDP—Unpacking President Sheinbaum's Bold Assertions"
============================================================

In a time when misinformation spreads faster than facts, separating myth from reality has never been more crucial. Following President Claudia Sheinbaum's recent `comments <https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/las-y-los-migrantes-contribuyen-a-la-economia-de-estados-unidos-presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-en-2024-aportaron-al-pib-781-mil-mdd>`_ on employment, migration, foreign trade, and economic history, a vital question resurfaces:

What is the true economic impact of Mexican immigrants in the United States?

To answer this question, we went straight to the source by analyzing data from the `U.S. Census Bureau <https://www.census.gov/>`_ and the `Federal Reserve's FRED <https://fred.stlouisfed.org>`_ database. The findings we uncovered may challenge common narratives, and believe me, they will.

This is a fact-based analysis, based solely on official U.S. government sources. No opinions or manipulations, just the numbers that matter, just the raw facts. Nothing else, just science to restore balance.

**Recommended Readings**
-------------------------


1. **Introductory/Basic Level**  
   *Introduction to the Economics of Immigration in OECD Countries*  
   **Author(s):** Institute of Labor Economics `Discussion Paper No. 13755 <https://docs.iza.org/dp13755.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`_

   This paper analyzes the impact of migration on the labor market and GDP in OECD countries. It explains in a simple way how to measure the contribution of immigrants to aggregate output, focusing on employment share rather than total population. Despite being a 2018 paper, it is a starting point for understanding the calculations developed.

2. **Intermediate/Medium Level**  
   *Rethinking the Benefits of Immigration: Theory and Evidence from the U.S.*  
   **Author(s):** Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano and Giovanni Peri `NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH Working Paper No. 11672 <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w11672/w11672.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`_

   This work is another good reference for understanding the meaning of the calculations performed in this article. It develops a two-sector macroeconomic model where natives and immigrants are imperfect substitutes. It then uses data from the Census/American Community Survey—extremely similar to the way we constructed the database—to empirically estimate the contribution each worker makes to GDP.

3. **Advanced/Specialized Level**  
   *Immigration and Economic Growth*  
   **Author:** George J. Borjas `NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH Working Paper 25836 <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25836/w25836.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`_

   This analysis provides a rigorous macro- and micro-level framework that links immigration inflows to changes in GDP growth rates and labor productivity, in close agreement with GDP projections for 2025 and GDP per worker that we estimated. It uses a formal model where :math:`GDP = f(K, L)`. to be linear-homogeneous. This allows for the decomposition of output per worker according to the proportion of native-born and immigrant workers, thereby making it possible to more accurately measure the sensitivity of the effects on GDP of an increase or decrease in immigrants.


**Data Sources**
-------------------------

1. **U.S. Census Bureau**: Provides population data for native and foreign-born groups.
2. **FRED ST Louis**: Supplies GDP and labor force participation rates.
3. **Custom Analysis**: Estimates GDP contributions by nationality based on labor force participation rates and official population statistics.

**Steps**
-------------------------

- Fetch and analyze GDP data for 2024 and project it forward to 2025, the FRED series (“Real Gross Domestic Product”) is reported in chained 2017 dollars, meaning 2017  is the reference (base) year for the inflation‐adjusted series for this article.
- Estimate labor force participation for native and foreign-born populations.
- Calculate GDP contributions by nationality and project future trends.
- Visualize results through interactive charts and tables.

Key Findings: Migrant Myths vs. Reality
-------------------------

As we mentioned, we will analyze the statements made by President Claudia Sheinbaum through a report published on the Mexican government's official website, which you can consult `here <https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/las-y-los-migrantes-contribuyen-a-la-economia-de-estados-unidos-presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-en-2024-aportaron-al-pib-781-mil-mdd>`_. 

Based on that report, we have found the following:

1. **Migrant Labor Force Participation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - In 2024, Mexicans born in the U.S. contributed $781 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), meaning that if they were an independent country, they would currently be the tenth largest economy in the world; while forecasts indicate that the Latino community could occupy third place in two or three years.

2. **Contributions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   - In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in taxes, including $25.7 billion to Social Security; $6.4 billion to Medicare; and $1.8 billion to unemployment insurance.
   - They complement the U.S. workforce in essential industries, as their workforce represents 51 percent of dairy farms and meat processing; 20 percent of manufacturing and agriculture; 15 percent of education and healthcare; 28 percent of healthcare assistants; and 25 percent of construction workers. and 54.3 percent of agricultural sorters.

3. **Security**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   - Immigrants have 60 percent less crime, and the states along the border with Mexico are safer and healthier compared to the northern border of the United States.

4. **Invesment and Entrepreneurship**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   - In 2021, one in five immigrants was an entrepreneur, generating $95.6 billion.

Let there be no misunderstanding about the purpose of this analysis, which is to show the general public the importance of science and the real data offered by the entities responsible for providing it. In an era of misinformation, clarity in calculations is essential, as you will see in the following points. There is a huge distortion between the official media and reality,

Here is some raw and crude information to help you understand this reality. Let's begin...

Statement 1 . **Migrant Labor Force Participation**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - In 2024, Mexicans born in the U.S. contributed $781 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), meaning that if they were an independent country, they would currently be the tenth largest economy in the world; while forecasts indicate that the Latino community could occupy third place in two or three years.

****Myths or Reality?****

The he argument of the Mexican government is based on the following calculation:

A. **Assumption 1**: Mexican-born residents - MBR - (ACS 2022):  11,710,000 people
B. **Assumption 2**: U.S. real GDP (2023, chained 2017): $22.671 Trillion USD (T-USD)
C. **Assumption 3**: Total U.S. population -TUP- (2023): 334,914,895 residents

Base just in this 3 assumtions, the Mexican government dares to make the following calculation that we present below:

.. math::

     ( \frac{11,710,000 MBR}{34,914,895 TUP} ) * $22.671 T-USD = $7603 Billion USD

The result is 781 Billion USD ... itself is revelated revelated and as stated in the statement issued by the Mexican government. However, this is a MYTH. To perform these measurements, based on the three articles discussed at the beginning of this article, there is a way to address this scientific problem, and that is through measurement by GDP per person employed (at constant prices).

Even official institutions such as the World Bank and the OECD use "GDP per person employed at constant prices for a specific year" as a measure of labor productivity, reflecting output per worker rather than averaging the total population, which is what GDP per capita does.

****And first one ...  why not use GDP per capita?****

**Reason 1**: GDP per capita divides the economic pie equally among everyone, pretending that each citizen has an equal share. In reality, the gap between the rich and the rest can be enormous; this measure hides those differences and obscures the real economic problems.

**Reason 2**: It includes the unemployed and is distorted by demographics. GDP per capita includes everyone: children, retirees, and non-working people. This means that countries with young populations, aging societies, or high unemployment appear less productive than they actually are. Only GDP per worker shows how much each active taxpayer actually generates.

So next time you see that official number, remember: if you want to measure real economic power, don’t fall for the myth. Follow the GDP per person employed¡ For this calculation, we will update all the data, making extrapolations and refining the data. To begin, we have adjusted the data by adding the following values ​​to the data provided by the report.For this calculation, we will update all the data, making extrapolations and refining the data. To begin, we have adjusted the data by adding the following values ​​to the data provided by the report.

For this calculation, we'll update all the data, making extrapolations and refining them. To begin, we've adjusted the data by adding the following values ​​to the data provided in the report. Understanding that for this we need to calculate the labor force, it's important to calculate it. Unfortunately, and until we can obtain official data, even the Bureau in charge of accounting for the country's population movements doesn't have a clear idea of ​​the magnitude of the wave of immigrants in the country, and they even admit it, the quote adds. 

Based on that and the data provided by the FRED we have estimated the labor force rate as follows, looking for our most avid readers such as national fiscal and banking institutions and serious economic institutions to make their calculations and also those who read us from the comfort of the office, but enough enough returning to the adjustments, we consider the lack of data on the labor force rate by country of origin in the resident population of the United States we will use the general estimate offered by the FRED, with it and the previous elements, the assumptions are as follows:

**Key Takeaway:**  
*This table provides a unified summary of key variables from the U.S. Census and FRED, forming the baseline for all following calculations.*


With this information we amplify the assumptions made by the Mexican government and will add additional elements to refine this analys adding as follow:

D. **Assumption 4**: EMP Ratio


This is a displayed the next calc for get the Assumption 4: :math:`EMP-Ratio = \frac{Total U.S. population}{Total U.S. labor force}`.

Assum Assumption 4 is as follows:

            <a href="_static/employment_ratio_timeseries_2007_2025.html">this link</a>.
        </iframe>
    </div>

**Key Takeaway:**  
*The employment ratio has fluctuated over time, impacting GDP calculations by group. Recent years show stronger labor force participation among foreign-born populations.*

By obtaining the EMP ratio, we can calculate, based on this estimator, the number of people by origin group within the United States that are part of the country's workforce. To do this, the following general formula will be used.


E. **Assumption 6**: Foreing-group LFC 

Base in alll asummptions we get the next adjust calc of the labor force of USA, for know that we build the next equation:

.. math::

 (X Foreing-group group) * EMP-RATIO = Foreing-group LFC


With all this ingredients we could calculate the contribution of GDP from Mexican-born LFC

F. **Contribution of GDP from Foreing-group LFC**

To calculate it and taking into account all the assumptions, it is as follows:

.. math::

 (\frac{X Foreing-group in LFC}{Total U.S. labor force}) * 100 = Contribution of GDP from Foreing-group LFC %

With all this Assumptions and recalibrate the datasets base from `U.S. Census Bureau <https://www.census.gov/>`_ and the `Federal Reserve's FRED <https://fred.stlouisfed.org>`_ database we get the next results:

    </div>

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Refined calculations reveal the GDP contribution of Mexican-born and other foreign-born groups, correcting common misconceptions in public discourse.*

As we can see in the table ¨GDP & Employment Table by Foreign-Born Group (Excludes Native, 2024)¨ the calculation issued by the Mexican authority has a quite important variation since when considering the total population, as we have mentioned before, it generates distortions that distance us from reality, according to these results the statement of Mexicans born in the U.S. contributed $781 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since their real contribution is ****$953.3 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)****

What remains to be clarified at this point is to contrast the contributions made by the Mexico foreign origin born group. According to the statement (which stated that the 781 billion USD is not accurate information), ****the contribution that this group makes to the US GDP is equivalent, compared to the member economies of the OECD, to the tenth largest economy in the world****. Unfortunately, as we can see here, ****this is also unverifiable****, since considering their own (implausible) statements, the size of the contribution of 781 billion USD would ****actually be equivalent to the fifteenth largest economy in the world****. If we included Russia and China in this analysis, ****the position would move to the eighteenth largest economy****, as can be seen in the following graph.

      </div>
    </div>


As we can see, even considering the contributions discussed in the official report, the reality is that according to their data, the contribution of the Mexican foreign origin group would not be the 11th largest economy but the 15th among the OECD members and 18th if we consider the major economies. But referring to the data that we have been able to collect and develop, the reality is that the contribution, as we mentioned, is **** 953.3 Billion USD****, so with that level of contribution, compared to the OECD member countries, it would place the ****Mexican foreign origin group**** as the fourteenth largest economy and if we talk about the largest economies ****the group occupy the seventeenth place**** as can be seen in the following graphs:

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Mexican foreign-born GDP contributions are significant, rivaling mid-sized OECD economies and far exceeding some official estimates.*


But let's not finish this statement without adding that Mexico isn't the only one contributing to the US GDP. Here are the top foreign origin groups that contributed the most in 2024:

Statement 2 . **Contributions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


   - In 2022, undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in taxes, including $25.7 billion to Social Security; $6.4 billion to Medicare; and $1.8 billion to unemployment insurance.
   - They complement the U.S. workforce in essential industries, as their workforce represents 51 percent of dairy farms and meat processing; 20 percent of manufacturing and agriculture; 15 percent of education and healthcare; 28 percent of healthcare assistants; and 25 percent of construction workers. and 54.3 percent of agricultural sorters.

****Myths or Reality?****

In order to address these assertions about the contributions of "undocumented" people, understood as those stays not authorized by the state are employed. The way in which these details are obtained is even more confusing, given that even within the same statistical analysis groups of the census boreau, they agree on the difficulty of obtaining precise data on this point. However, we attempt to obtain more credible statistics based on the information available at the time of this analysis.

To answer the concerns that arise it is necessary to divide the problem into some parts more accessible to the calculation, so first of all we are going to quantify the number of unauthorized persons and for this what was collected is based on the information provided by the `Office of Homeland Security Statistics <https://ohss.dhs.gov/>`_ office that collects statistical information on this subject and in whose reports you can find the most precise information, in this sense we interpolate some extraneous data and based on the results, Below is the estimated number of these unauthorized persons and how many are employed, based on the employment rates and GDP per capita estimated for the years that have been presented above, as follows:

        </iframe>
    </div>

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Unauthorized immigrant employment fluctuates with economic cycles but consistently supports key U.S. sectors.*

Based on the data already collected in point 1 and the data on unauthorized individuals in the United States, we will calculate the number of unauthorized employees. Based on the same methodology used to calculate the contribution of citizens of Mexican parents, we need to do the same and determine how many unauthorized individuals are of Mexican origin, as shown in the following graph. Similar to the trends in unauthorized immigration, one of the interesting aspects of this research is that, after 2017, unauthorized immigration to the United States not only decreased, but actually plummeted, as shown in the graph.

Some point to President Obama's strict deportation priorities and increased border patrols; others, to the devastating COVID-19 lockdowns. Whatever the cause, migration came to a complete halt, only to resurface strongly in 2021 and continue to increase as economic crises related to the disruption of economic dynamism in Latin American countries, the Middle East, and most of the world due to lockdown measures had global repercussions.

Starting in 2021, migrant caravans the size of small cities will once again make the news, but now they are a reality in the Americas. They are not just statistics on a spreadsheet; they are humanity in motion, a living barometer of the geopolitical distortions and economic inequality created by the impact of the disruption of many production lines and value chains destroyed during this process.

To contrast the report and the comments from the Mexican government, it is necessary to compare the proportion of unauthorized Mexicans in the United States: 4 out of 10 unauthorized immigrants in the United States are Mexican citizens. This is not hyperbole that might astonish any economist; it is proof of an unbreakable bond between the United States and Mexico, that we need to study mor deeply.

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Unauthorized employment is concentrated among specific national groups, emphasizing their workforce importance.*

And the story doesn't end there. Migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, driven by violence, climate disasters, and extreme poverty, are arriving en masse, turning a regional tragedy into a continental movement. Even China has quietly claimed its share of this migration pie, representing approximately 2% of the unauthorized population, reminding us that the current global economic distortions spare no one.

Based on publicly available databases and based on the unequivocal assumption that American employees pay their taxes directly, we compiled the evolution of tax collection as a percentage of GDP, resulting in the following:

    </div>

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Immigrants contribute to federal taxes and payroll at rates similar to native-born workers.*

From this contribution of the country's tax collection rates, we obtain the following distribution of the contributions that unauthorized employees generate as taxes. Once the data on contributions made by American workers and citizens is obtained, the level of contributions from unauthorized workers living in the United States is estimated. The calculation is significant.

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Unauthorized immigrants make significant contributions to the U.S. GDP, underscoring their vital role in the economy.*


Even unauthorized Mexican immigrant workers contribute a little over $107 billion to the treasury, a similar amount to the amount mentioned in the report. However, the proportions reported by the Mexican government are unverifiable based on the data, as the contribution to Social Security ****is just over $52 billion, $12 billion to Medicare, and just over $42 billion to income tax figures quite different from those determined in the official report.****

*Tax contributions from unauthorized immigrants vary by country of origin but are a consistent fiscal benefit.*


Another element to check is the contribution of unauthorized workers to the country's industries. To do this, we must estimate the distribution of employees by each industry in the economy for natives and foreign-born workers, which is as follows:

Something interesting to note is that the three industries where Native Americans are most heavily employed are services, except for public administration. This represents 12.9% of the total Native American population, followed by the information sector with 8.9% and the transportation and warehousing services sector with 8.6%, showing that services and computer development have the greatest share.

As well as services, information development and mobility are the sectors where there is the greatest native participation. Based on the available data on the distribution of the employed population by industry in the United States, based on the resulting distribution from population data and estimates of foreigners born in Mexico and unauthorized immigrants from Mexico, we have obtained the following results:

As can be seen in the chart for both groups, the main industry where the majority of the employed population participates is manufacturing with a share of 15.4%, construction with 12.3%, and professionals in science, management, and administrative and waste management services with 9.6%.

****Interesting results, since it is normally thought that the foreign-born population is dedicated solely to agricultural construction; however, the agricultural sector (8.7%) is the fourth largest activity. These results do not support what Mexican authorities have said about the distribution of immigrant labor and undocumented immigrants in the United States. Again, we address the inconsistency of the Mexican government's information.****


Statement 3 . **Security**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Immigrants have 60 percent less crime, and the states along the border with Mexico are safer and healthier compared to the northern border of the United States.

****Myths or Reality?****

In order to answer the question of crime, we had to adapt our search to the analysis of cub scouts offered by the best agency, the FBI. For this, we analyzed the violent crimes reported on their website (link). From there, we branched the search by violent crimes and the origin of those who commit them. With these assumptions, we classified violent crimes according to the FBI under the following categories:

* Rape
* Aggravated Assault
* Homicide
* Robbery

To identify the Latinos mentioned in the report, each group was categorized as follows:

- Not Hispanic or Latino
- Not Specified
- Unknown
- Hispanic or Latino

Based on the FBI's results for the entire country, we obtained the following interesting conclusions about violent crimes committed in the United States:

- Rape is the second most frequent violent crime in the country, with 205,593 violent crimes, according to statistics provided by the FBI. Of these crimes, 4 out of 10 were committed by non-Hispanic or non-Latino groups. Based on the data for this atrocious violent crime, the Latino community has the lowest incidence, with 1 in 10 cases of rape as a violent crime in the USA (67,267).
- Aggravated Assault presents similar patterns in this case, with 4 out of 10 cases generated within the country being of non-Hispanic or non-Latino origin (38,171).
- In this case, homicide is observed to be of Latino origin (8,576), while 4 out of 10 are from non-Hispanic or non-Latino groups (38,171).
- Robbery repeats the same pattern, with approximately 3.9 incidents per 10 inhabitants caused by non-Hispanic or non-Latino groups (412,161).

As seen in the following graph, we can analyze in detail the ethnic distribution of violent crimes within the country:

    </div>

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Most crimes are committed by people identified as Not Hispanic or Latino, but the data also shows a significant number of 'Not Specified' and 'Unknown' offenders across all major crime types.*

One of the most controversial and politicized issues of recent decades, and currently in recent months, is the development of drug-related crime. It is precisely here that we add an interesting statistic to our analysis: Drug Narcotics violations. In the case of drug-narcotics violations, we obtained the following results:

* Result 1

    </div>

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Drug/Narcotic Violations have the highest proportion of Not Hispanic or Latino offenders, but also a notable number of 'Not Specified' and 'Unknown' cases.*


This is revealing because, as in the previous pattern, the incidence of drug-narcotics violations among the Latino community is barely 10%. In the case of the community with the highest incidence of this type of crime, this similarity is not only evident but also reinforced, with 5 out of 10 drug-related crimes being the work of non-Latino, non-Hispanic groups.

This is what happens in the United States… but what is happening within the country? … specifically in the border states? Below is the interactive map of crime on the border, since the report issued by Mexico speaks of a lower incidence rate of crime among the Latino community, and as we can see, this is graphically true.

**Key Takeaway:**  
*Crime patterns and offender ethnicities vary widely across U.S. border states, with some states showing notably higher rates for certain crimes or groups.*

At first hand we can see that the usual violent crimes on both borders are assaults and robberies, however, **the issue that infers us in the map is the drug narcotic violations and as you can see on the northern border the incidence is much lower (530,888) crimes related to drug narcotics violations much less than on the southern border (826,866) which again dismisses the vision of the Mexican government**, because even though the northern border of the USA has a greater distance, weather conditions and controls play an important role in the number of crimes of this nature, however **it is also important to highlight here that in most border states, only in New Mexico is where there is evidence that the majority group related to drug narcotic violations is of Latino origin, however in all other border states the Latino group does not appear as the main group, dismissing another deep-rooted idea about the Latino community and drugs.**


Statement 4. **Invesment and Entrepreneurship**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - In 2021, one in five immigrants was an entrepreneur, generating $95.6 billion.

****Myths or Reality?****

Answering this question requires taking statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau on self-employment. According to these statistics, there are 17,296,359 native-born citizens who are self-employed through offering their services or creating their own businesses, 960,131 citizens born in Mexico who also participate in the economy through entrepreneurship, and in the case of the migrant community, a total of 528,072.

Generally speaking, 10% of native-born citizens are self-employed, while 14.6% of those born in Mexico are self-employed. In the case of the undocumented Mexican community, this represents 17.3%, and for the native-born community, it is 9.6%. It is interesting to note that the undocumented group is the most self-employed.

The lack of legal documentation creates difficulties in obtaining formal employment. However, they turn to self-employment. In a land of opportunity and a system designed for economic growth through individual productivity, it is possible to prosper even without documentation, and this is worth highlighting because it is clear evidence that strong and autonomous institutions and the preservation of justice define a country's economic conditions.

**Key Takeaway:**  
*This chart shows the distribution of self-employed Unauthorized Mexican workers across industries in 2022.*

In the case of the Mexican government's claim that 4 out of 5 immigrants are entrepreneurs, reviewing the data provided by US statistics departments also fails to verify this. Estimating this information shows that for every 10 native-born citizens employed in the US, 1 is an entrepreneur; for every 10 foreign-born Mexican citizens, 1 is an entrepreneur; and in the case of unauthorized Mexicans, approximately 2 out of 10 are entrepreneurs.

But it is necessary to answer the last question... is the contribution of the Mexican self-employed $95 billion, as claimed by the Mexican authorities? To do this and as we have done throughout the analysis offered we will base ourselves on the estimates made previously (See Statements 1,2,3) leaving our calculation per person self-employed and eye here we must specify that this calculation is still based on the methodology that we have been developing does not take into account elements such as the real heat of the salaries for each sector and neither the estimates based on the profits that these self-employments generate in reality, here we are making an estimate as accurate as possible taking into account the REAL information available, in this case what is said by the Mexican government is not verified since the level of contribution of self-employment is TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR MILLION THREE HUNDRED NINETY-TWO THOUSAND dollars so it is far from what was argued by the Mexican official media and unfortunately this only politicizes the information which generates divisions and disputes like those seen in the United States and in Mexico in the last days.
